# Blockchain-Fault-Transaction-Detection-Using-Machine Learning
The increasing adoption of blockchain technology in various domains, ensuring the integrity and security of transactions within the blockchain network has become paramount. This project present a novel approach for detecting faulty transactions in blockchain systems by leveraging machine learning algorithms. Through the integration of machine learning, our solution will analyze transaction patterns, detect irregularities, and classify potential faults. The implementation will involve training the model on historical blockchain data to enable accurate identification of fraudulent or suspicious activities.
We aim to enhance the reliability and security of blockchain networks by developing a system that can autonomously identify and flag anomalous transactions.

Data Collection: Gather historical blockchain transaction data, including details such as transaction amounts, timestamps, and involved parties. Ensure a diverse dataset that covers various transaction types and scenarios to facilitate robust machine learning model training.

Preprocessing: Cleanse and preprocess the collected data by handling missing values and outliers. Encode categorical features, standardize numerical values, and split the dataset into training and testing sets for effective machine learning model training and evaluation.

Feature Extraction: Extract relevant features from the transaction data, such as transaction frequency, transaction size, and patterns. Create additional features that capture temporal aspects or relationships between transactions to enhance the model's ability to detect faults.

Model Selection: Choose suitable machine learning algorithms such as XG Boost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression for fault detection, considering the nature of blockchain transactions and the complexity of potential faults.Experiment with models like decision trees, random forests, or neural networks to identify the most effective approach for the specific blockchain context.

Model Training: Train the selected machine learning model on the training dataset, utilizing techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness. Fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance the model's ability to generalize and adapt to different patterns within the blockchain transaction data.

Evaluation: Assess the model's performance on the testing dataset using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. Iteratively refine the model based on evaluation results, aiming to achieve a balance between accurate fault detection and minimizing false positives.
